# WhereRU
Pulls building information from the Rutgers building API
### Purpose of Application

* Allow current Rutgers students to easily see building information around them. 
Currently, students have to go online to search the building directory. 
This application pulls the building information given a building number or building title.
The application also provides a one-touch navigation options that will bring up Google Maps turn-by-turn directions
from the users current location to the building location.

### Purpose of Design

* The application mostly uses a simple listview which makes the UI very easy to navigate and lets users quickly choose
the campus that they want. The UI distractions have been minimized by providing a simple and clean interface that makes
navigation very easy. Since the only required element in terms of UI was some kind of Table Layout, that has been included
in the details portion for the buildings.
